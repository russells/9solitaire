Play the 3x3 solitaire game automatically.

Currently plays the game automatically on a terminal.  The stacks are
presented across the screen rather than in a 3x3 grid - this does not
affect the game play at all.

The rules:

- Lay out nine cards.

- For each cards in the "pairs" Ace and 10, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, 4 and 7, 5
  and 6, place a new card on each of the members of the pair.  (These
  "pairs" add up to 11.)

- For the triples Jack, Queen, King, place a new card on each of those.

- Continue until all the cards are laid on the table in nine stacks.

- If the game cannot be completed, pick up the stacks beginning at the top
  left, putting each stack in turn at the bottom of the pack, and start
  dealing again.  (Currently both versions of the game get this slightly
  wrong, starting at the bottom left.)

Nuances:

- You should only cover the Jack, Queen, King triples three times.

- At the end of a correctly completed game, you should end up with one
  Jack, Queen, King triple, and three other "pairs".  If this is not the
  case you have done something wrong - covering up Jack, Queen, King four
  times is the most common mistake.

Playing automatically:

- ./9solitaire.py is the python version.

- ./9solitaire is the C version.  Compile 9solitaire.c and 9solitaire.h
  with make.

- Either version will play a single game with a randomly generated pack if
  invoked without arguments.

- If given a single integer argument, they will play that many games, using
  one randomly generated pack.

- The C version is about 60 times faster than the python version.
